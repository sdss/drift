This library provides an asynchronous interface with modbus devices over a TCP ethernet controller (such as [this one](https://www.wago.com/us/controllers-bus-couplers-i-o/controller-modbus-tcp/p/750-862)) and control of the connected I/O modules. The code is a relatively thin wrapper around [Pymodbus](http://riptideio.github.io/pymodbus/) with the main feature being that it's possible to define a PLC controller and a complete set of modules as a YAML configuration file which can then be loaded. It also provides convenience methods to read and write to the I/O modules and to convert the read values to physical units.

This code is mostly intended to interface with the SDSS-V [FPS](https://www.sdss.org/future/technology/) electronic boxes but is probably general enough for other uses. It's originally based on Rick Pogge's [WAGO code](https://github.com/sdss/FPS/tree/master/WAGO).
